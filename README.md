# Project Yellowstone: Old Faithful

Project Yellowstone Old Faithful is the project to make all of Solana's history accessible, content addressable and available via a variety of means. The goal of this project is to completely replace the Bigtable dependency for Solana history access with a self-hostable, decentralized history archive that is usable for infrastructure providers, individual Solana users, explorers, indexers, and anyone else in need for historical access.

## Overview


## Archive access

The archive is currently under development. There will be two main ways to access the archive during its development phase:

1. Via Filecoin: Through collaboration with Protocol Labs and a Filplus allocation we are uploading all historical data to Filecoin. From here, any user can access the full histortical archive verifiably and freely from the Filecoin network. This is helpful as a way to test retreivals and fetch individual transactions.
2. Bulk transfer: If you want to start testing full epoch archives, we can provide you with access to a storage bucket from where you can pull the epoch archives


## Tooling

The tooling used in this project is based in the `radiance` tool developed by Jump's Firedancer team. It is rapidely developing, and active development for this project is currently based out of this repository and branch: [Radiance Triton](https://github.com/gagliardetto/radiance-triton/tree/tx_meta/).

The radiance tool utilises the rocksdb snapshots that have been generated by [Warehouse](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-bigtable) nodes. From these snapshots 

Currently, this tool is being tested from the following warehouse archives:
  - Solana Foundation (public)
    -  gs://mainnet-beta-ledger-us-ny5
    -  gs://mainnet-beta-ledger-europe-fr2
    -  gs://mainnet-beta-ledger-asia-sg1
  - Triton One (private)

If you have warehouse nodes generating rocksdb archive snapshots, please contact lk@triton.one (even if they can't be made publicly available). We would like to have you generate CAR files for verification purposes.
